# Linear Summary Function
This project creates a simple R function called `linear_summary()` that fits a linear regression model between two numeric variables and returns the `slope`, `intercept`, and `r-squared` value in a tidy tibble. It’s designed to be flexible, easy to use, and consistent in its output.

### The project includes:

- **Function definition:** A clean and documented function using roxygen2 tags.

- **Examples**: Demonstrations using real datasets like mtcars and iris to show how the function works.

- **Testing**: Formal tests using the `testthat` package to check that the function behaves correctly with perfect data, missing values, and invalid input.

This project shows how to build, document, and test a custom R function following good programming and reproducibility practices.
